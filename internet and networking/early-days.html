            <h2>Beginnings of the Internet</h2>
            <p>The Internet began with ARPANET, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. It was the first network to use the packet-switching technique, which allowed multiple computers to communicate on a single network. This innovation laid the groundwork for the Internet as we know it today.</p>
            <p>In the early days, the Internet was primarily used by researchers and academics. However, as technology advanced and became more accessible, the Internet began to reach a broader audience. The introduction of user-friendly interfaces and web browsers further accelerated its growth.</p>
